Market Research Modernization with Machine Learning and Power BI 
# 🧠 Market Research Modernization with Machine Learning & Power BI

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and Business Intelligence tools can modernize traditional market research techniques by uncovering hidden patterns and delivering strategic insights.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Simulate realistic market research data (competitor mentions, sentiment, ad spend, engagement)
- Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means) to segment competitors based on behavior
- Visualize insights using both Python and Power BI dashboards

---

## 📊 Dataset

A synthetic dataset was created using Python to simulate over 400 records with the following features:

- `Brand` – Competitor names  
- `Mentions` – Public/media mentions  
- `Sentiment` – Public sentiment score  
- `Ad_Spend_USD` – Estimated ad spending  
- `Engagement_Score` – Audience engagement metric

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **StandardScaler** for data normalization  
- **K-Means Clustering** (k=3) to segment competitors:
  - Smart Spenders
  - Big Spenders
  - Low Visibility Players

### 📈 Python Visualization

- Scatter plot: Ad Spend vs Engagement Score colored by cluster  
- Plotted clusters confirmed meaningful separation

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

A two-page interactive Power BI dashboard was developed:

### Page 1: Market Overview
- Bar chart: Total mentions by brand  
- Scatter plot: Ad Spend vs Engagement  
- KPI Cards: Market totals

### Page 2: Competitor Deep Dive
- Pie chart: Sentiment per brand  
- Bubble scatter plot (Ad Spend, Engagement, Mentions)  
- Matrix table and slicers for interactive filtering
